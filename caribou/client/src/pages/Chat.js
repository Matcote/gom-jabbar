        <p>Hey Bruno!</p>
        <p>
          Sorry about the missing chat page ðŸ˜…. I know some of my code for this
          project may not be optimal, all of this is new to me. If you're a bit
          on the fence right now about hiring me, I truly believe you would not
          regret it if you do. Not gonna lie, the first couple weeks to months
          might be a bit rocky, but what I lack in experience I make up for in
          passion and quick learning. I really think that long term I will be an
          incredible asset for your team, I somehow feel I was born to code...
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of what you choose, I thank you for this opportunity and
          wish you the best of luck in the future! OROHealth is bound to
          succeed, I truly believe that!
        </p>
